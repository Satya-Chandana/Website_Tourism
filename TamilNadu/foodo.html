                                Ooty also has yards of tea plantation. Try the tea from the roadside tea vendor. Along with the smell of the tea, you will also feel the aroma of Nilgiri hills. Sit on the wooden crooked bench and enjoy this tea, it will be an amazing experience, for which you need to pay almost nothing. You can also bring home some local tea for your future use.

                                Despite the fact that kababs are not a South Indian specialty, they are a highly popular meal in the city thanks to a few excellent restaurants. Visit any of the roadside kebab vendors or dhabas in Ootacamund to tickle your palette with these oil-dipped delicacies. Tear into luscious grilled chicken or lamb portions, or the equally delicious soya and paneer kebabs. Kebabs go well with a butter naan (Indian leavened flatbread coated in butter).

                                Dosas, the Indian equivalent of a very thin pancake, are immensely popular due to their wide range of batter, stuffing, and size. Dosas are crepe-like in texture and appearance, and are cooked with fermented batter and fenugreek on a skillet greased with oil or ghee (clarified butter). They must be consumed with care. Dosas come in a variety of flavours, including rawa, rawa masala, onion rawa, and others. They go well with many varieties of chutney and sambhar (vegetable chowder).

                                Idlis are round cakes made from a batter of steamed rice and fermented black lentil. Sometimes, fenugreek is added to the batter to give it flavour. Idlis are a popular, sort-of-staple food in the South Indian states.
 
                                Vada is a savoury, fried snack. To many, it may look like a fried version of doughnuts. Vadas are of several types made of legumes (pigeon pea, chickpea, black gram, green gram), potatoes and sometimes even with curd (dahi vada).
