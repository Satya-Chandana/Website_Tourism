        <h1>Kabab Corner, Ooty</h1>
        <p >
            Juicy, melt-in-the-mouth kebabs are the forte of this food joint that is tucked away in the corner. It is extremely difficult to leave once you sample their goodies. Small as it is, you might have to wait for a little, but then, good things don’t come easy, do they? Regulars recommend the chicken kebabs and grilled mutton served here. Chinese and North Indian dishes also find a place on the menu here. Considering that the place is a little small, some of you might find the dishes priced a bit steeply, but you will still order them by the loads.</p>
