            Apart from being the spiritual capital of Tamil Nadu, Madurai, for many Tamilians is also the state’s culinary capital. Madurai is not just quintessential Tamil cuisine; the city’s food culture has also been shaped by communities such as the Madurai Saurashtrians (from Gujarat) and the brief phase when this city was lorded over by the Madurai sultanate. You have to be willing to roll up your sleeves and shun cutlery to truly relish Madurai’s culinary treasures, and deal with the constant clanging of kothu parotta stalls once the sun goes down. The recent clampdowns might have curbed the tradition of all-night food stalls, but an array of street food eateries and family-owned restaurants ensure you can still get your fill of comfort food until midnight. We pick seven emblematic Madurai dining establishments—ideal starting points to eat your way through Madurai.</p>
