                            You may have heard of Dosa. Appam, on the other hand, is a Kanyakumari dish that you won't find anywhere else. The Appam blend is a well guarded secret. It is prepared in a wok and is fried on one side and steam cooked on the other.

                            Tapioca is mostly cultivated in Kaniyakumari. When this season comes, farmers dig it out from the field and sell it freshly. Tapioca will be peeled and cut into pieces and boiled in water with salt for taste. When it is been cooked properly, water will be removed and served with Fish Curry.

                            If you're new to Kanyakumari and wander out in the nighttime, you could hear some strange sounds from the hotels' striking irons. Don't freak out. It merely indicates that the hotel's chef is preparing Kothu Parotta or Minced Parotta.However, there is no replacement for Kanyakumari's Kothu Parotta. If you watch how it is created, you will be shocked to watch our local chefs' rapid moving hands over the parottas to mince it together with some chicken or eggs or anything you request.

                            Another distinguishing feature of Kanyakumari District. It's known as Pazha Bajji. If you go to a neighbourhood tea shop, you might see some small yellow coloured cylindrical delicacies. Yes! That is Pazha Bajji. Ripe bananas were dipped in Maida batter and fried till they turned yellow. To get into the banana, you must first get through the yellow batter, and then you will be able to taste the banana. It will undoubtedly be a novel experience for outsiders.
