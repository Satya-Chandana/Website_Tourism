            The term Kerala was first epigraphically recorded as Ketalaputo (Cheras) in a 3rd-century BCE rock
            inscription by emperor Ashoka of Magadha. It was mentioned as one of four independent kingdoms in 
            southern India during Ashoka's time, the others being the Cholas, Pandyas and Satyaputras. The Cheras
            transformed Kerala into an international trade centre by establishing trade relations across the
            Arabian Sea with all major Mediterranean and Red Sea ports as well those of the Far East. The early
            Cheras collapsed after repeated attacks from the neighboring Cholas and Rashtrakutas.
</br>
</br>
</br>
            During the early Middle Ages, Namboodiri Brahmin immigrants arrived in Kerala and shaped the society
             n the lines of the caste system. In the 8th century, Adi Shankara was born at Kalady in central Kerala.
            He travelled extensively across the Indian subcontinent founding institutions of the widely influential
            philosophy of Advaita Vedanta. The Cheras regained control over Kerala in the 9th century until the
            kingdom was dissolved in the 12th century, after which small autonomous chiefdoms, most notably the
            Kingdom of Kozhikode, arose.
</br>
</br>
</br>
            In 1498, Vasco Da Gama established a sea route to Kozhikode and raised Portuguese settlements, which 
            marked the beginning of the colonial era of India. European trading interests of the Dutch, French and
            the British East India companies took centre stage during the colonial wars in India. After the Dutch 
            were defeated by Travancore king Marthanda Varma, the British crown gained control over Kerala through
            the creation of the Malabar District in northern Kerala and by allying with the newly created princely
            state of Travancore in the southern part of the state until India was declared independent in 1947.
            The state of Kerala was created in 1956 from the former state of Travancore-Cochin, the Malabar district 
            and the Kasaragod taluk of South Canara District of Madras state.

            Perhaps the most famous festival of Kerala, Onam, is deeply rooted in Kerala traditions. Onam is associated 
            with the legendary king Mahabali (Maveli), who according to tradition and Puranas, ruled the Earth and several
             other planetary systems from Kerala. His entire kingdom was then a land of immense prosperity and happiness. 
             However, Mahabali was tricked into giving up his rule, and was thus overthrown by Vamana (Thrikkakkarayappan)
             , the fifth Avatar (earthly incarnation) of Lord Vishnu. He was banished from the Earth to rule over one of 
             the netherworld (Patala) planets called Sutala by Vamana. Mahabali comes back to visit Kerala every year on 
             the occasion of Onam.

            There are legends dealing with the origins of Kerala geographically and culturally. One such legend is 
            the retrieval of Kerala from the sea, by Parasurama, a warrior sage. It proclaims that Parasurama, an Avatar
            of Mahavishnu, threw His battle axe into the sea. As a result, the land of Kerala arose, and thus was 
            reclaimed from the waters.

            The oldest of all the Puranas, the Matsya Purana, sets the story of the Matsya Avatar (fish incarnation) of 
            Lord Vishnu, in the Western Ghats. The earliest Sanskrit text to mention Kerala by name as
            Cherapadah is the Aitareya Aranyaka, a late Vedic work on philosophy. It is also mentioned in both the 
            Ramayana and the Mahabharata.
