        Summer is the most economical season for a Kochi trip, as it is the offseason for the city. In summer the temperatures rise quite high, 
        almost touching 37°C. The hot and humid climate in the daytime is not favorable for outdoor sightseeing. In summer Kochi is relatively 
        less crowded. The best part is that you will get amazing discounts on everything.

        Monsoon is one of the ideal seasons for planning a Kochi trip. Kochi features a tropical monsoon climate. This season is also not a peak
        season but is better than summer. However, the atmosphere remains humid but one can enjoy outdoor sightseeing. Kochi comes alive during 
        the rains and one can find rain-washed greenery all around. During monsoon, one can get good deals on hotels and even on flights.

        time. This season is best to enjoy a family trip.
