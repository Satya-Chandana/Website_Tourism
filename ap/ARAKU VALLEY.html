<div style="color: deepskyblue;"><h2>COFFEE MUSEUM</h2></div>
<p></p><h2>Araku Valley Coffee Museum, as the name suggests, is a museum that puts the historical journey of Araku coffee and related products in India. It's a great place to be for the coffee and chocolate lovers who love taking a walk back into time when coffee was just about to make a mark in this part of India.</h2><p></p>
<p></p><h2>This famous coffee house in the Araku Valley is the main origin of pure coffee and its triumph stretches from the Araku Valley to Ethiopia. This exceptional cafe-cum-museum in the Araku Valley is famous and notable for its aromatic coffee drinks. This unique museum is an underlying part of an upmarket coffee house that serves coffee, brownies, chocolates, sandwiches and more. It provides both drinkable and edible types of coffee. Edible items include a variety of coffee-based chocolates, brownies, mousses and tarts. However, it is different from any other coffee cafe and the credit goes to the ‘Coffee-Museum’, which is called the ‘Sampoorna Coffee Gallery’.</h2><p></p>
<div style="color: floralwhite;"><h2>HISTORY BEHIND THE COFFEE MUSEUM</h2></div>
<p></p><h2>The idea of establishing a coffee museum in Araku Valley was first thought by Prakash Rao and he established it. In 1930, he set up a general catering service here, which was initially only for tourists. Realizing the uniqueness of the coffee produced in the Araku Valley, he began to promote Araku Coffee worldwide. At that time Arabica Coffee was grown in different parts of India as opposed to Robusta Coffee. Eventually his highlighting process succeeded and in 1954 he was able to open a coffee house with a coffee museum. Recently this coffee paradise was only open to foreign delegates and coffee traders but fortunately now it is open to everyone.</h2><p></p>
