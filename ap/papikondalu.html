</h1></div><img src="papikondalu 3.jpg"ait="papikondalu 3"height="300" width="300"style="float:left">
<div style="color: olive;"><p><h2>Running along the river Godavari (Western Godavari), Papikondalu mountain range is located in Rajahmundry, Andhra Pradesh. Papikondalu is a sheer eye-candy. As the hills get closer to the visitor, the width of the mighty Godavari becomes narrower.
    Initially named as 'Papidi' Kondalu with Paidi meaning the middle partition of a womanâ€™s hair in Telugu, this view is said to resemble that partition. However, the region came to be known as Papikondalu in the local language eventually. The river narrowing its twists and turns along with the Papi Hills is a breathtaking sight! Its beauty is often compared to Kashmir's, as the area around the ranges is quaint and bountiful with nature. The ranges also boast of waterfalls at Munivaatnam.</h2></p></div>
